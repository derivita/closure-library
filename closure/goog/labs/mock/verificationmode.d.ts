/**
 * A mode which defines how mock invocations should be verified.
 * When an instance of `VerificationMode` is passed to
 * `goog.labs.mock.verify`, then that instances's `#verify`
 * method will be used to verify the invocation.
 *
 * If `#verify` returns false, then the test will fail and the
 * description returned from `#describe` will be shown in the
 * test failure message.  Sample usage:
 *
 * goog.module('my.package.MyClassTest');
 * goog.setTestOnly('my.package.MyClassTest');
 *
 * var testSuite = goog.require('goog.testing.testSuite');
 * var verification = goog.require('goog.labs.mock.verification');
 *
 * var times = verification.times;
 *
 * testSuite({
 * setUp: function() {
 * // Code creating instances of MyClass and mockObj.
 * },
 *
 * testMyMethod_shouldDoSomething: function() {
 * myClassInstance.myMethod();
 *
 * goog.labs.mock.verify(mockObj, times(1));
 * }
 * });
 *
 * For an example implementation, see `TimesVerificationMode_`.
